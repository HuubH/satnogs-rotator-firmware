## Instructions
In order to use this code, you need to put the AccelStepper v1.46 library and SoftI2CMaster library in your libraries folder. Thanks to [AccelStepper library](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/) and [SoftI2CMaster](https://github.com/todbot/SoftI2CMaster).

You need to choose the version of the Firmware you will be utilizing based on your controller and rotator setup. Namely we have two different versions (one for DC motors and one for Stepper motors). DC version is on beta state.
